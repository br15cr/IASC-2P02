    <p>      On the subject of graphs and charts, Johanne Drucker brings up an interesting point.

      Her argument is that charts and graphs should not use quantitive data.

      She reminds us that the "raw data" used to create graphs had to be interpreted before it could be collected.

      So, rather than having information provided for us, Drucker suggests that graphs should contain some ambiguity, allowing the viewer to come up with conclusions of their own.
      
      I can see where Drucker is coming from.

      Graphs allow their creators to be selective about the data they provide and withhold from the user.
      A graph showing the final marks of a course may show a student who recieved a 42.
      The graph omits information like whether that student failed because they were genuinely struggling with the course, or slacking off, or at what point in time they started falling behind.
      This is relevent information being left out so the creator can prove a point.
    </p>
    <p>
      However Drucker's proposed solution of using qualitative data in charts instead of quantitative data raises its own problems.
      
      Although it doesn't pose itself as fact or "raw data", an interpreted recollection of the source is still used to fabricate the data.
      
      
      
      Second, there is not much to interperate when it comes to data collected from measurements.
      There just doesn't seem to be other related information associcated with it.
