    <p>      On the subject of graphs and charts, Johanne Drucker brings up an interesting point.

      Her argument is that charts and graphs should not use quantitive data.

      She reminds us that the "raw data" used to create graphs had to be interpreted before it could be collected.

      So, rather than having information provided for us, Drucker suggests that graphs should contain some ambiguity, allowing the viewer to come up with conclusions of their own.
      
      I can see where Drucker is coming from.

      Graphs allow their creators to be selective about the data they provide and withhold from the user.

      A graph showing the final marks of a course may show a student who recieved a 42.

      The graph visually omits information like whether that student failed because they were genuinely struggling with the course, or slacking off, or at what point in time they started falling behind.

      This is relevent information being left out so the creator can prove a point.
    </p>
    <p>
      However Drucker's proposed solution of using qualitative data in charts instead of quantitative data raises its own problems.

      Although it doesn't pose itself as fact or "raw data" as much as quantitive data would; an interpreted recollection of the source is still used to fabricate the data.

      Data collection methods can also place a filter on the resulting data.

      A simple True or False question or even sometimes a multiple choice may not be sufficient enough to get an accurate answer in a survey.

      Sometimes the truth is more complicated than a yes or no.

      There is also the issue of interpretation.

      Like art, some people might get it; but others won't understand.

      Leaving ambiguity without explaination or frame of reference defeats the purpose of charts and graphs.
      
      
      Second, there is not much to interperate when it comes to data collected from measurements.
      There just doesn't seem to be other related information associcated with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drucker wants a graph that leaves the interpretation to the viewer rather than the data collector.

      But with the method she suggests, the viewer will have to interpret a qualitive interpretation of the source.

      
      What I suggest is instead of replacing quantitive data with qualitive data, add more quantitive data.

      Rather than having just two axis within the graph, add a new one for each new category.

      This would also open up the graph to interpretation, as it no longer makes a clear argument to the viewer.</p>
