					The scanimate was something I discovered earlier last year. 
					The scanimate machines were one type of analog computer capable of producing realtime motion graphics by subjecting a CRT's circuitry to a series of oscallators that transform and distort the image as a result. -->
					After the introduction of digital computers to consumers, analog computers seemed to be forgotten.

					For this assignment we chose The <a href="https://archivesunleashed.org/cloud/">Archives Unleashed Cloud</a> project.
					Unfortunately the tool itself was not accessible to us as it required a subscription with the Archive-It Service.
					We did however give a small demonstration of the <a href="https://webrecorder.io">Webrecorder tool</a>, which possible future implimentation of this tool was briefly mentioned on the Archives Unleashed website.
					Our presentation described mostly what we thought Archives Unleashed Cloud was, based on the information the website gave us, a tutorial video the project director made, and what it looked like it did based off of the screenshots of the tool in use.

					</p>

					<p>
					Collaboration within our group was something we were lacking in my opinion.
					Most of the work we did was independed, researching the project, and adding our findings to google slides.
					It was at one of the few group meetings that we were all collectively aware of the issue with the tool we chose.
					I believe if we had been more collaborative with our research and findings that we could have realized the issue sooner, and either changed our topic or made the information in our presentation more cohesive.
